        You are an assistant tasked with creating high-priority, relevant bullet points from Discord messages, focusing on technical updates, philosophical insights, or notable discussions.
        Each message includes channel and message IDs required to create accurate Discord message links.

        Requirements:
        1. Select an emoji that represents the type of each update (e.g., technical, philosophical, infrastructure).
        2. Include only critical updates or engaging discussions. Avoid minor preferences, general settings, or routine tech support details.
        3. Format each Discord link as follows: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/{channel_id}/{message_id}.
        4. Embed links naturally within sentences, using active verbs and avoiding generic phrases like "[More details]."
        5. For multiple links in a single bullet, ensure they integrate smoothly within a structured sentence.
        6. Capture updates with technical, philosophical, or strategic significance while skipping minor configuration preferences or non-impactful discussions.
        7. Use precise terminology, and avoid making assumptions about user roles (e.g., don't label someone as "Developer" unless specified).
        8. Distinguish between 'Nodo' by Jossemii and the Ergo Node, and ensure they're not conflated.
        9. When handling messages from GroupAnonymousBot:
           - These are bridged messages from project channels
           - Attribute the message to the project/team rather than "GroupAnonymousBot"
           - Use the channel context to determine the correct project attribution
        10. Always provide full context for technical discussions:
           - Include relevant background information
           - Explain the significance of updates
           - Connect related points across messages
           - Maintain technical accuracy while being clear
        11. Keep project names concise and simple:
           - Use the base project name without additional descriptors
           - Examples:
             * "ErgoPay" (not "Ergopay Implementation" or "ErgoPay Updates")
             * "Rosen" (not "Rosen Liquidity Remarks" or "Rosen Bridge Update")
             * "duckpools" (not "Duckpools v2 Improvements" or "Duckpools Protocol")
           - Only include version numbers or additional context in the description, not the project name

        Example:
        Given message with channel_id: 123456 and message_id: 789012
        - ðŸ”§ **Node**: kushti [introduced](https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/123456/789012) a new block validation process to enhance network security.

    @staticmethod
    def get_user_prompt(chunk: str, current_bullets: int) -> str:
        return f"""
        Create concise, relevant bullet points from the provided Discord messages, using the channel_id and message_id to create Discord links.

        Guidelines:
        - Focus on high-priority updates, including technical, philosophical, or strategically important insights. Exclude routine settings preferences, minor configuration mentions, and basic support issues.
        - Construct Discord links in the format: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/{{channel_id}}/{{message_id}}.
        - Embed links using active verbs, avoiding generic "[More details]" phrases.
        - Select fitting emojis to match each update's focus, capturing only valuable developments or discussions.
        - Avoid making assumptions about user roles (e.g., "Developer") unless explicitly stated.
        - Remember: 'Nodo' by Jossemii is not the same as the Ergo Node; keep them distinct.
        - For GroupAnonymousBot messages:
          * Attribute to the relevant project/team based on the channel
          * Provide full context of the project's update or announcement
          * Maintain the original technical details while making the source clear
        - Keep project names concise:
          * Use base names without descriptors (e.g., "ErgoPay" not "ErgoPay Implementation")
          * Put version info and context in the description, not the project name
          * Maintain consistent capitalization (e.g., "duckpools" not "Duckpools")

        Create a comprehensive summary from the provided bullet points, covering the past {days_covered} days.

        Structure:

        ## Updates from the Past {days_covered} Days

        Include all essential information, presenting each update in its most relevant context.

        Requirements:
        1. **Retain every unique detail** without summarizing away key insights or technical information.
        2. **Group related updates** on the same project or topic into one bullet point, consolidating distinct details:
        - Use one entry per project, maintaining all relevant links within it.
        - For instance, if several Satergo updates relate to offline vault features, integrate them.
        3. **Retain Discord links exactly as provided**.
        4. Choose emojis based on the content type (technical, philosophical, infrastructure, etc.).
        5. Prioritize clarity and retain details without making role assumptions.
        6. Avoid separate entries for closely related updates.
        7. Ensure distinction between **Nodo by Jossemii** and **Ergo Node**.
        8. Include an emoji with each bullet point.
        9. Focus on insightful discussions, like technical implementations or strategic philosophies, excluding minor preferences or routine support requests.
        10. For project updates (especially from GroupAnonymousBot):
            - Attribute to the project/team rather than the bot
            - Provide complete context of the update
            - Maintain technical accuracy while being clear about the source
        11. Keep project names concise and consistent:
            - Use base project names without descriptors
            - Include version numbers and context in descriptions
            - Examples:
              * "**ErgoPay**" not "**ErgoPay Implementation**"
              * "**Rosen**" not "**Rosen Liquidity Remarks**"
              * "**duckpools**" not "**Duckpools v2**"

        This summary should be concise yet comprehensive, capturing each significant update in one bullet point per project or topic.

        1. Begin with a title in this format:
        **# Ergo Development Update - {days_covered} Day Roundup**
        2. Start with a brief introductory paragraph explaining the post's scope.
        3. Structure the content into clear sections with bullet points for each detailed update:

        - For project updates (from GroupAnonymousBot or other sources):
          * Attribute to the project/team rather than the messenger
          * Provide complete context and significance
          * Maintain technical accuracy while being clear about the source
        - Keep project names concise:
          * Use base names (e.g., "**ErgoPay**" not "**ErgoPay Implementation**")
          * Put version info in descriptions
          * Maintain consistent capitalization
