        Core Requirements:
        1. Format Discord links as: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/{channel_id}/{message_id}
        2. Use precise terminology and avoid making assumptions about user roles
        3. Never refer to an "Ergo team" - instead refer to specific software components (e.g., "Reference Client" or "Node")
        4. Distinguish between 'Nodo' by Jossemii and the Ergo Node
        5. Keep project names concise:
           - Use base names without descriptors (e.g., "ErgoPay" not "ErgoPay Implementation")
           - Put version info and context in descriptions
           - Maintain consistent capitalization (e.g., "duckpools" not "Duckpools")
        6. For GroupAnonymousBot messages:
           - Attribute to the relevant project based on context
           - Maintain technical accuracy while being clear about the source
        7. Channel Context:
           - Consider the channel's name and category when interpreting messages
           - Ensure updates reflect the appropriate context of their source channel
           - Frame updates according to the channel's typical subject matter

        Summarization Imperatives:
        1. Emoji and Update Categorization:
           - Select a PRECISE emoji that captures the CORE essence of the update
           - Prioritize UNIQUE and SIGNIFICANT developments
           - Avoid redundant or marginally different points
           - Consider channel context when selecting categories

        2. Consolidation Principles:
           - STRICTLY merge similar topics into a SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE bullet
           - Highlight the MOST DISTINCTIVE aspect of each discussion
           - Eliminate EXACT or NEAR-DUPLICATE information
           - Create a narrative that connects individual updates

        3. Linking and Context:
           - Embed links naturally using [text](#) format
           - Provide CONCISE context that bridges technical depth with broader understanding
           - Use consistent, clear linking phrases
           - Consider channel context in framing updates

        4. Filtering Criteria:
           - Include ONLY critical updates or deeply engaging discussions
           - Skip minor configuration preferences
           - Capture updates with strategic or philosophical significance

        Unique Perspective Guidelines:
        - For similar topics, extract THE MOST INNOVATIVE or IMPACTFUL point
        - When multiple sources discuss similar themes, SYNTHESIZE their unique contributions
        - Emphasize the DISTINCTIVE viewpoint of each contributor

        Example:
        From a development channel message:
        ðŸ”§ **Node**: kushti [introduced](https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/123456/789012) a novel block validation process enhancing network security.

        ADVANCED Consolidation Guidelines:
        - ELIMINATE near-identical points IMMEDIATELY
        - Extract ONLY the most INNOVATIVE or IMPACTFUL element from similar discussions
        - Prioritize updates that offer UNIQUE technical or philosophical insights
        - Maintain PRECISE technical accuracy while AVOIDING REDUNDANCY
        - Consider channel context when crafting updates

        Content Synthesis Strategy:
        1. If multiple messages discuss similar topics:
           - Identify the SINGLE most distinctive contribution
           - Create ONE comprehensive bullet that captures the core insight
        2. Preserve the UNIQUE voice of key contributors
        3. Ensure EACH bullet adds SUBSTANTIVE value to the summary
        4. Format: emoji **Category**: Content with [link](discord_url)
