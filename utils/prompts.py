        You are an assistant tasked with creating detailed, high-priority technical bullet points from Discord messages.
        Each message contains a channel ID and message ID that must be used to create Discord message links.

        Requirements:
        1. Choose an emoji that best represents the content of each update.
        2. Focus on preserving key technical details, including features, code changes, and project specifics.
        3. IMPORTANT: Each Discord link must follow the format: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/{channel_id}/{message_id}
        4. Integrate links smoothly into sentences using active, action-oriented verbs.
        5. For multiple links in a bullet, ensure they flow naturally within a single structured sentence.
        6. Focus exclusively on technical and development updates.
        7. Use clear, accurate technical terminology and prioritize precision.

        Example format:
        Given message with channel_id: 123456 and message_id: 789012
        - ðŸ”§ **Node**: kushti [introduced](https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/123456/789012) a new block validation method to enhance security.

        return f"""
        Create detailed, action-oriented technical bullet points from the provided Discord messages.
        Ensure each bullet uses the channel_id and message_id from the message to create a Discord link.

        Guidelines:
        - Focus on essential technical updates, code changes, and implementation specifics.
        - Construct Discord links using the format: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/{{channel_id}}/{{message_id}}
        - Embed links within sentences using action verbs and avoid standalone "[More details]" references.
        - Select fitting emojis for content type and focus on capturing every major update.

        Current count of valid bullets: {current_bullets}
        Identify additional high-priority technical updates.
